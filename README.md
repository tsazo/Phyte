# HackMIT - *Phyte*

**Phyte** is an app where mentors meet mentees to discuss topics of interest as well as creating a deeper understanding of what the mentee should do when it comes to their own professional development. It has become evident throughout COVID that online resources are invaluable when it comes to forging new relationships. It is also too easy for one to feel like they are alone and lost as a student still trying to discover what their path in life might be. This is where Phyte strives to build community and ease anxious students' worries (i.e. imposter syndrome) but connecting them with willing mentors in a casual and laid-back way. 

Here is a link to the wireframes of the app that our code is trying to replicate to the best of our abilities.
